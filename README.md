# node-playground
A collection of small Node.js projects that I created while learning node. :roller_coaster:

## Steps to run the projects:
 * Install Node.js.
 * A few projects may need MongoDB. So, install it as well.  
 * Change directory to project you want to run.
 * Run
   ```
    npm install
   ```
 * Point your browser to 127.0.0.1:3000 to see the output. :simple_smile:
